# Control protocol

SoundCraft can be driven completely by other programs: scripts, test harnesses and AI agents.
Every menu item, button, mouse gesture and keystroke maps to a **command** (or to synthetic
input), and every command is reachable from:

| Surface | How |
|---|---|
| Desktop app control channel | `soundcraft --control <port>` (`0` = pick a free port; printed as `SOUNDCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT=…`) |
| CLI against a running app | `soundcraft-cli app --port <port> <method or command id> [JSON]` |
| Headless CLI | `soundcraft-cli run --demo --cmd 'mix.volume={"track":"Kick","db":-6}' --bounce out.wav` |
| MCP (headless) | `soundcraft-cli mcp [--demo]` |
| MCP (bridged to the app) | `soundcraft-cli mcp --connect <port>` |

## Wire format

Newline-delimited JSON over TCP on `127.0.0.1`. One request per line, one reply per line:

```json
{"id": 1, "method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "track.new", "params": {"count": 2, "format": "Stereo"}}}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"tracks": [12, 13]}}
```

Errors: `{"id": 1, "ok": false, "error": "bad parameters for `mix.volume`: no track named `Nope`"}`.

## Methods

| Method | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `engine.execute` (alias `command`) | `{command, params}` | Run a command programmatically. **Never opens a dialog**; empty params use defaults or the current selection. |
| `engine.commands` | `{filter?}` | Every command: id, label, menu path, shortcut, params doc, enabled + reason. Includes UI-layer commands (`window.*`). |
| `engine.parity` | `{}` | Parity report against the incumbent's menu catalog. |
| `session.inspect` | `{detail?: "summary"|"full"}` | The document: tracks, clips (with times), inserts (+params when full), sends, routing, automation, markers, groups, busses, sources (`loaded` true when decoded audio is in the pool), selection, transport, undo label. |
| `ui.inspect` | `{}` | UI state (`window`, panels, dialogs), window size, playing/position, audio device, and `edit_layout` (timeline rect and every track row's rect, for clicking). |
| `ui.set` | any `UiState` fields | e.g. `{"window": "Mix", "narrow_mix": true}`. |
| `ui.menu.list` | `{}` | Every catalog menu path and the command that implements it (or null). |
| `ui.menu.invoke` | `{path}` or `{id}` | Like clicking the menu item: may open its dialog (e.g. `"Track > New..."`). |
| `ui.click` | `{x, y, button?, count?, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}` | Synthetic click (window points). |
| `ui.drag` | `{x, y, to_x, to_y, steps?}` | Synthetic drag with the primary button. |
| `ui.move` | `{x, y}` | Move the pointer. |
| `ui.scroll` | `{x, y, dx?, dy?, phase?, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}` | Trackpad scrolling in window points. Positive deltas move content right/down. Omit `phase` for a complete gesture; use `start`, `move`, `end`, `cancel` for a sequence, including momentum. |
| `ui.zoom` | `{x, y, factor}` | Pinch at a window position; factor > 1 zooms in, < 1 zooms out (0.01–100). |
| `ui.key` | `{key, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}` | Key press (`Space`, `Enter`, `A`, `F7`, `=`…). |
| `ui.text` | `{text}` | Type text into the focused field. |
| `ui.screenshot` | `{path?}` | PNG of the window (base64 in `png_base64` when no path). |
| `app.quit` | `{}` | Quit. |

## Positions and references

In the Edit window, two-finger scrolling pans the timeline horizontally and the tracks vertically,
including when the pointer is over a ruler or track header. Pinching zooms the timeline continuously
around the pointer, preserving the sample underneath it within the zoom and timeline-start limits.
Shift+scroll pans horizontally; Cmd+scroll (Ctrl off macOS) uses the same anchored zoom.
Natural scroll direction and momentum come from the platform's input stream. Moving the timeline
away from the playhead during playback pauses automatic following until the playhead is brought
back into view or the scrolling mode is reselected.

Agents can also call `view.zoom_at {"factor": 1.25, "anchor_px": 200}` through `engine.execute`;
`anchor_px` is measured from the timeline's left edge. `ui.scroll` and `ui.zoom` exercise the actual
pointer-input path, while `view.scroll` and `view.zoom_at` directly control saved view state.

- Tracks: id (number) or name (`"Kick"`).
- Clips: id (from `session.inspect`).
- Positions: samples (`96000`), seconds (`{"seconds": 2.5}`), or a time string in any timebase,
  optionally prefixed: `"bars_beats:5|1|000"`, `"min_secs:0:12.500"`, `"timecode:00:00:10:00"`,
  `"samples:48000"`.
- Ranges: `start` + `end` (or `start` + `length`); omitted = the current edit selection.

## Examples

```sh
P=$(soundcraft --demo --control 0 | sed -n 's/SOUNDCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT=//p')   # or read stderr
soundcraft-cli app --port $P mix.solo '{"track":"Bass"}'
soundcraft-cli app --port $P transport.play
soundcraft-cli app --port $P ui.screenshot '{"path":"/tmp/shot.png"}'
soundcraft-cli app --port $P ui.menu.invoke '{"path":"Track > New..."}'
```

Offscreen (no window): `cargo run -p soundcraft-ui-egui --example ui_shot -- out.png script.jsonl`,
where each script line is a request (`{"method": …, "params": …}`), `{"shot": "path.png"}` or
`{"steps": n}`.

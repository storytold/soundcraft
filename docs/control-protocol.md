# Control protocol

SoundCraft can be driven completely by other programs: scripts, test harnesses and AI agents.
Every menu item, button, mouse gesture and keystroke maps to a **command** (or to synthetic
input), and every command is reachable from:

| Surface | How |
|---|---|
| Desktop app control channel | `soundcraft --control <port>` (`0` = pick a free port; printed as `SOUNDCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT=…`) |
| CLI against a running app | `soundcraft-cli app --port <port> <method or command id> [JSON]` |
| Headless CLI | `soundcraft-cli run --demo --cmd 'mix.volume={"track":"Kick","db":-6}' --bounce out.wav` |
| MCP (headless) | `soundcraft-cli mcp [--demo]` |
| MCP (bridged to the app) | `soundcraft-cli mcp --connect <port>` |

## Wire format

Newline-delimited JSON over TCP on `127.0.0.1`. One request per line, one reply per line:

```json
{"id": 1, "method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "track.new", "params": {"count": 2, "format": "Stereo"}}}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"tracks": [12, 13]}}
```

Errors: `{"id": 1, "ok": false, "error": "bad parameters for `mix.volume`: no track named `Nope`"}`.

## Methods

| Method | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `engine.execute` (alias `command`) | `{command, params}` | Run a command programmatically. **Never opens a dialog**; empty params use defaults or the current selection. |
| `engine.commands` | `{filter?}` | Every command: id, label, menu path, shortcut, params doc, enabled + reason. Includes UI-layer commands (`window.*`). |
| `engine.parity` | `{}` | Parity report against the incumbent's menu catalog. |
| `session.inspect` | `{detail?: "summary"|"full"}` | The document: tracks, clips (with times), inserts (+params when full), sends, routing, automation, markers, groups, busses, sources (`loaded` true when decoded audio is in the pool), selection, transport, undo label. |
| `ui.inspect` | `{}` | UI state (`window`, panels, dialogs), window size, playing/position, audio device, and `edit_layout` (timeline rect and every track row's rect, for clicking). |
| `ui.set` | any `UiState` fields | e.g. `{"window": "Mix", "narrow_mix": true}`. |
| `ui.menu.list` | `{}` | Every catalog menu path and the command that implements it (or null). |
| `ui.menu.invoke` | `{path}` or `{id}` | Like clicking the menu item: may open its dialog (e.g. `"Track > New..."`). |
| `ui.click` | `{x, y, button?, count?, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}` | Synthetic click (window points). |
| `ui.drag` | `{x, y, to_x, to_y, steps?}` | Synthetic drag with the primary button. |
| `ui.move` | `{x, y}` | Move the pointer. |
| `ui.key` | `{key, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}` | Key press (`Space`, `Enter`, `A`, `F7`, `=`…). |
| `ui.text` | `{text}` | Type text into the focused field. |
| `ui.screenshot` | `{path?}` | PNG of the window (base64 in `png_base64` when no path). |
| `app.quit` | `{}` | Quit. |

## Positions and references

### Edit and Mix windows

`window.mix` and `window.edit` open or bring the requested main window to the front.
Both views stay open and share the same session, selection, undo history, transport and audio
engine. `window.toggle_mix_edit` (Cmd+=, Ctrl+= off macOS) switches focus between them.
`window.close` closes the active main view when both are open, keeping the other view and
session alive; the closed view can be reopened from the Window menu.

`window.arrange_tile`, `window.arrange_tile_h`, `window.arrange_tile_v`, and
`window.arrange_cascade` open both views and arrange them within the original main-window
workspace. Horizontal tiles stack the views; vertical tiles place them side by side;
automatic Tile chooses based on the workspace dimensions. Native hosts use separate OS
windows; browser and offscreen hosts use movable, resizable windows within the canvas.

`ui.inspect.main_windows` reports the primary and active view, whether Edit/Mix are open,
and their last known rectangles. Native rectangles use desktop coordinates in egui points;
embedded rectangles use canvas coordinates. `ui.window` identifies the active view and
`ui.both_windows` records whether both are open. Existing preferences and `ui.set` requests
that select a single view remain supported.

- Tracks: id (number) or name (`"Kick"`).
- Clips: id (from `session.inspect`).
- Positions: samples (`96000`), seconds (`{"seconds": 2.5}`), or a time string in any timebase,
  optionally prefixed: `"bars_beats:5|1|000"`, `"min_secs:0:12.500"`, `"timecode:00:00:10:00"`,
  `"samples:48000"`.
- Ranges: `start` + `end` (or `start` + `length`); omitted = the current edit selection.

## Examples

```sh
P=$(soundcraft --demo --control 0 | sed -n 's/SOUNDCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT=//p')   # or read stderr
soundcraft-cli app --port $P mix.solo '{"track":"Bass"}'
soundcraft-cli app --port $P transport.play
soundcraft-cli app --port $P ui.screenshot '{"path":"/tmp/shot.png"}'
soundcraft-cli app --port $P ui.menu.invoke '{"path":"Track > New..."}'
```

Offscreen (no window): `cargo run -p soundcraft-ui-egui --example ui_shot -- out.png script.jsonl`,
where each script line is a request (`{"method": …, "params": …}`), `{"shot": "path.png"}` or
`{"steps": n}`. Use `--system-theme light|dark|none` to supply the initial OS appearance, and
script events such as `{"system_theme": "dark"}` to change it on subsequent frames.

Appearance defaults to Dark. `ui.theme {"mode":"system"}` follows the appearance supplied by
the native or web integration at launch and on later frames, while the saved choice stays System.
When the integration cannot report an appearance, System uses Dark. Manual Light and Dark stay
fixed when the OS appearance changes. An offscreen render without `--system-theme` supplies no
OS appearance and therefore resolves System to Dark.

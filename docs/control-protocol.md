# Control protocol

SoundCraft can be driven completely by other programs: scripts, test harnesses and AI agents.
Every menu item, button, mouse gesture and keystroke maps to a **command** (or to synthetic
input), and every command is reachable from:

| Surface | How |
|---|---|
| Desktop app control channel | `soundcraft --control <port>` (`0` = pick a free port; printed as `SOUNDCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT=…`) |
| CLI against a running app | `soundcraft-cli app --port <port> <method or command id> [JSON]` |
| Headless CLI | `soundcraft-cli run --demo --cmd 'mix.volume={"track":"Kick","db":-6}' --bounce out.wav` |
| MCP (headless) | `soundcraft-cli mcp [--demo]` |
| MCP (bridged to the app) | `soundcraft-cli mcp --connect <port>` |

## Wire format

Newline-delimited JSON over TCP on `127.0.0.1`. One request per line, one reply per line:

```json
{"id": 1, "method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "track.new", "params": {"count": 2, "format": "Stereo"}}}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"tracks": [12, 13]}}
```

Errors: `{"id": 1, "ok": false, "error": "bad parameters for `mix.volume`: no track named `Nope`"}`.

## Methods

| Method | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `engine.execute` (alias `command`) | `{command, params}` | Run a command programmatically. **Never opens a dialog**; empty params use defaults or the current selection. |
| `engine.commands` | `{filter?}` | Every command: id, label, menu path, shortcut, params doc, enabled + reason. Includes UI-layer commands (`window.*`). |
| `engine.parity` | `{}` | Parity report against the incumbent's menu catalog. |
| `session.inspect` | `{detail?: "summary"|"full"}` | The document: tracks, clips (with times), inserts (+params when full), sends, routing, automation, markers, groups, busses, sources (`loaded` true when decoded audio is in the pool), selection, transport, undo label. |
| `ui.inspect` | `{}` | UI state (`window`, panels, dialogs), window size, playing/position, audio device, `edit_layout` (timeline and track row rects), and `midi_layout` (piano roll/velocity rects and MIDI viewport, for clicking). |
| `ui.set` | any `UiState` fields | e.g. `{"window": "Mix", "narrow_mix": true}`. |
| `ui.menu.list` | `{}` | Every catalog menu path and the command that implements it (or null). |
| `ui.menu.invoke` | `{path}` or `{id}` | Like clicking the menu item: may open its dialog (e.g. `"Track > New..."`). |
| `ui.click` | `{x, y, button?, count?, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}` | Synthetic click (window points). |
| `ui.drag` | `{x, y, to_x, to_y, steps?}` | Synthetic drag with the primary button. |
| `ui.move` | `{x, y}` | Move the pointer. |
| `ui.key` | `{key, cmd?, shift?, alt?, ctrl?}` | Key press (`Space`, `Enter`, `A`, `F7`, `=`…). |
| `ui.text` | `{text}` | Type text into the focused field. |
| `ui.screenshot` | `{path?}` | PNG of the window (base64 in `png_base64` when no path). |
| `app.quit` | `{}` | Quit. |

## Positions and references

The docked MIDI editor supports two-finger, diagonal, momentum, Shift+scroll and
pinch/Cmd+scroll gestures over the piano roll, piano keys, header and velocity lane. Horizontal scrolling
pans time; vertical scrolling pans pitch with subpixel precision. Notes, hit testing, the grid and
velocity stems share the same horizontal viewport. The editor opens with the whole clip visible;
zoom in to pan through it, and use **Fit** to restore the whole-clip view. Zoom stays between 1×
and 1024×, time panning stays within the clip, and pitch panning stays within MIDI notes 0–127.
Gestures in this editor leave the Edit timeline and the session document unchanged.

With a selected MIDI clip and an open, rendered MIDI editor, agents can also call
`ui.midi_zoom_at {"factor": 1.25, "anchor_px": 200}`,
`ui.midi_scroll {"by_px": 20, "by_y_px": 9}`, or `ui.midi_fit {}` through `engine.execute`.
The anchor is measured from the piano roll's left edge; positive pan values move the viewport
toward later ticks and lower pitches. The returned view contains `zoom`, `scroll_ticks` and
`top_pitch`. MIDI view state persists when the dock is closed/reopened; selecting another clip
starts with that clip fitted and its notes centred vertically.
- Tracks: id (number) or name (`"Kick"`).
- Clips: id (from `session.inspect`).
- Positions: samples (`96000`), seconds (`{"seconds": 2.5}`), or a time string in any timebase,
  optionally prefixed: `"bars_beats:5|1|000"`, `"min_secs:0:12.500"`, `"timecode:00:00:10:00"`,
  `"samples:48000"`.
- Ranges: `start` + `end` (or `start` + `length`); omitted = the current edit selection.

## Examples

```sh
P=$(soundcraft --demo --control 0 | sed -n 's/SOUNDCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT=//p')   # or read stderr
soundcraft-cli app --port $P mix.solo '{"track":"Bass"}'
soundcraft-cli app --port $P transport.play
soundcraft-cli app --port $P ui.screenshot '{"path":"/tmp/shot.png"}'
soundcraft-cli app --port $P ui.menu.invoke '{"path":"Track > New..."}'
```

Offscreen (no window): `cargo run -p soundcraft-ui-egui --example ui_shot -- out.png script.jsonl`,
where each script line is a request (`{"method": …, "params": …}`), `{"shot": "path.png"}` or
`{"steps": n}`.

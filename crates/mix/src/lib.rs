//! The SoundCraft mix engine.
//!
//! [`MixEngine::render`] produces one block of the main output for a session at a timeline
//! position: clips (with clip gain and fades) → trim/phase → inserts → pre-fader sends → fader and
//! mute (with automation) → pan → post-fader sends → busses → aux inputs → main → master faders.
//! The same code drives realtime playback and offline bounces, so what you hear is what you get.
//! Steady-state rendering does not allocate.
//!
//! ## Surround
//! The main mix has the format of the session's main output path ([`Session::main_format`]:
//! stereo by default, up to 16 channels such as 7.1.4 or 9.1.6) and every bus has its own format.
//! Channels are in SMPTE / WAV order (L R C LFE Ls Rs …, see
//! [`ChannelFormat::speakers`](soundcraft_model::ChannelFormat::speakers)). Routing a strip into a
//! destination builds a gain matrix per block:
//! - mono/stereo sources into a stereo destination use the stereo pan exactly as before;
//! - into a multichannel destination they use the track's [`SurroundPan`] (pairwise
//!   constant-power panner over the speaker layout, see `soundcraft_dsp::pan::surround_gains`),
//!   or go to L/R with the stereo pan when the track has no surround pan;
//! - sources whose format equals the destination's pass straight through, channel for channel;
//! - other multichannel sources fold to stereo with ITU-R BS.775 coefficients (C and surrounds at
//!   -3 dB, LFE dropped), or map speaker by speaker into other multichannel layouts.
//!
//! ## Plugin instances and threads
//! [`MixEngine::sync`] brings plugin instances in line with the session. Built-in plugins are
//! cheap (allocation only) and are always created there, on whichever thread renders. Hosted
//! third-party plugins (`clap:` / `vst3:` ids, see [`is_third_party`]) are expensive and have
//! main-thread rules, so a realtime host keeps them off the audio thread:
//! - with [`MixEngine::set_external_instances`]`(true)` (realtime playback), `sync` never creates a
//!   third-party plugin. The host's control (UI) thread creates them with [`create_instance`] from
//!   [`instance_specs`] (restoring each insert's stored [`Insert::state`] and calling `prepare`
//!   there), and hands them over with [`MixEngine::adopt`]; `sync` then moves the matching one
//!   into its slot. A slot whose instance has not arrived yet passes audio through.
//! - every instance `sync` replaces or removes (built-in or not) goes to a retired list instead of
//!   being dropped; the host takes it with [`MixEngine::take_retired`] and drops it on the control
//!   thread, so plugin destruction never runs on the audio thread either.
//! - without external instances (the default: offline [`render_range`], bounces, tests) `sync`
//!   creates third-party plugins itself, synchronously, restores their stored state before the
//!   first `process`, and drops retired instances at the end of `sync`.
//!
//! An instance starts from its stored state; the insert's parameter values are then applied on
//! top before the first block (the session's values are kept in step with the plugin, including
//! edits made in its own editor, so both agree; the state carries everything else). A host reads
//! states back for saving through each instance's [`Plugin::state_reader`], on its UI thread.
//!
//! A built-in instrument's parameter values are applied the same way. A sample-playing
//! instrument (the Sampler) is handed the decoded audio of its insert's
//! [`Insert::sample`] source straight from the session's pool, shared and never copied.
//!
//! [`Insert::state`]: soundcraft_model::Insert::state
//! [`Insert::sample`]: soundcraft_model::Insert::sample
